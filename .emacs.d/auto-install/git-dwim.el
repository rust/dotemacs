;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides context-aware git commands.
;; Currently only `git-branch-next-action'.
;;
;; `git-branch-next-action' does typical branch handling.
;;    * If current branch is master: switch to other or new branch.
;;    * If current branch is not master: switch to other branch or merge this branch to master.
;;    * If merge is failed: continue merging (You have to resolve conflict merker)

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `git-branch-next-action'
;;    Do appropriate action for branch.
;;  `git-create-new-branch'
;;    Create new BRANCH and switch to it.
;;  `git-switch-to-other-branch'
;;    Switch to existing BRANCH.
;;  `git-merge-to'
;;    Merge this branch to master.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put git-dwim.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'git-dwim)
;; (global-set-key "\C-xvB" 'git-branch-next-action)

;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET git-dwim RET
;;
