o ... What is IIIMECF?

  IIIMECF conforms IIIM Protocol Specification defined by Sun Microsystems,
and consists of a library to create IIIM awared applications and a simple
input method library controlled by IIIM server(s).
(This input-method is denoted by "iiimcf-sc" hereafter.)

  This version supports Emacs 20.6 or later; and Meadow 1.10 or later.
Mule-UCS is indispensable.  I recommend to use this library with Mule-UCS
version 0.82 or later.

  I confirmed that iiimcf-sc can work with ATOK X for Linux and ATOK/IIIMF
on Solaris 8.

  You can obtain Mule-UCS from ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/Mule-UCS.
And ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/IIIM is the primary distribution site
of IIIMECF.

  I am planning to adapt IIIMECF to XEmacs too.

o ... Installation

  To byte compile IIIMECF, you can use iiimcf-comp.el.
Enter the following command line:
--
  emacs -q --no-site-file -batch -l iiimcf-comp.el
--
If you use Meadow, enter the following:
--
  Meadow95(NT) -q --no-site-file -batch -l iiimcf-comp.el
--
And then, you will obtain byte-compiled emacs-lisp files.
Finally, you should install lisp directory to your site-lisp directory.

  That's all for usual installation processes.  For configuration,
please refer to the section of "Configuration of iiimcf-sc".

o ... Modules

  Currently, IIIMECF consists of the following modules.

  (1) ... iiimp.el

	A IIIM protocol library.  This module provides
	fundamental facilities to communicate with IIIM servers.

  (2) ... iiimcf.el

	This module provides general facilities to compose IIIM clients,
	e.g., dispatching events, translating messages for Emacs,
	generating client descriptor, and so on.

  (3) ... iiimcf-sc.el

	This module provides a simple input method, which forwards almost
	all of the operations related to input method conversions to
	IIIM server, and is controlled by IIIM server.

o ... Configuration of iiimcf-sc.

  You should configure or confirm at least the following variables.

  iiimcf-server-control-hostlist  The default value is '("unix:/var/run/iiim/.iiimp-unix/9010")

    Specifies IIIM servers.  The format is like "<PROTO>:<SERVER>:<PORT>".
  You can specify more than one server.  Although, currently, iiim-sc
  tries to connect the first server, it will be able to switch servers
  dynamically in the future.

  Example:  (setq iiimcf-server-control-hostlist
             '("localhost" "tcp:iiim:9010" "iiim.foo.com:9000"
               "unix:/var/run/iiim/.iiimp-unix/9010"))

  If you omit <PORT>, iiimcf-server-control-default-port will be used.
  The default value of this variable is 9010. If you omit <PROTO>,
  use iiimcf-server-control-default-protocol. The default value of this is tcp.

  If you specify "unix/:9010", it tries to connect through unix domain socket.

  iiimcf-server-control-username  The default value is (user-login-name)@(system-name)

    Username sent to IIIM server.  Normally, you don't have to set this variable,
  but if you would like to specify username and machine name explicitly, set this
  variable.  Note that the old htt_server may work wrong if you omit the part
  after `@'.

  Example:  (setq iiimcf-server-control-username "himi@tae.m17n.org")
	
  iiimcf-server-control-default-language  The default value is nil.

    Input method language used by default.  If nil, use the first
  candidate sent by server.  FYI, you can switch this by C-cC-\C-l
  later.

  You can customize iiimcf-server-control-preedit-open-string,
  iiimcf-server-control-preedit-close-string,
  iiimcf-server-control-preedit-face-alist,
  iiimcf-server-control-preedit-use-face-p, .etc.
  As to these variables, please refer the documentation strings.

  (BTW, iiim-sc uses custom package to define all of the customizable
   variables.  Thus, by executing M-x customize-group
   iiimcf-server-control, you can configure them.)

  Naturally, you need to load iiimcf-sc.
  To do this, add (require 'iiimcf-sc) to your configuration file.

  After you load iiimcf-sc, you can use a new input method,
  iiim-server-control.
  If you can use this by default, please add:
  (setq default-input-method 'iiim-server-control)

  Example.
--
  (setq iiimcf-server-control-hostlist
        '("localhost" "iiim:9010" "iiim.foo.com:9000" ))
  (setq default-input-method 'iiim-server-control)
  (require 'iiimcf-sc)
--
